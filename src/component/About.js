                <p>Name is Isak. 31 year old Swede living in Malm√∂ and trying to learn programming. Goes okay I guess.
                    While I am interested in programming I have other interest as well. Football, music, computer games is high on the list. 
                    Better if you combine them in some way. 
                    Anyway, while I don't have much experience yet in programming, I am a keen and fast learner. So if it sounds interesting, here are some ways to contact me.
